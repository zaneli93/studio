## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL(210, 70%, 50%) - RGB(38, 117, 225), a classic, clear, highly usable bright blue, evoking focus and productivity, in a professional style.
- Background color: HSL(210, 20%, 95%) - RGB(242, 245, 249), a very light, desaturated blue for a calm and clean background.
- Accent color: HSL(180, 60%, 40%) - RGB(41, 179, 179), a teal which, being an analogous hue to blue, and of a moderate saturation, draws appropriate attention without being overwhelming.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif for a clean and modern look.
